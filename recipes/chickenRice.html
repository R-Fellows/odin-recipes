        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Place rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat
            to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
          </li>

          <li>
            Meanwhile, place chicken breast halves into a large saucepan, and
            fill the pan with water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 20 minutes,
            or until done. Remove chicken from water. When cool enough to
            handle, cut meat into bite-size pieces.
          </li>

          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13
            inch baking dish.
          </li>

          <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses. In a
            separate bowl, mix together cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom
            soup, onion, and salsa. Layer 1/2 of the rice, 1/2 of the chicken,
            1/2 of the soup and salsa mixture, and 1/2 of the cheese mixture in
            prepared dish. Repeat layers, ending with cheese.
          </li>

          <li>Bake in preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or until bubbly.</li>
